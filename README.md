# RMS Components Styleguide

This styleguide is intended to provide examples of key components, for use in RMS forms. The components are originally provided by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), which has then been customised slightly with UI tweaks and custom colours.

The `rms.css` file inside `dist/css` contains the compiled Bootstrap CSS + RMS customisations, and needs to be included in projects using these components.

Every component here is compatible with Bootstrap's customisation capabilities, such as sizing and colours. This styleguide does not go through all of the possible examples, as Bootstrap details them way better. To see them all, [view Bootstrap's full documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/).

> Note: Some of the examples are inside containers with a fixed width, to prevent them from spanning unusually wide.
